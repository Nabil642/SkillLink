Edit `backend/.env` (choose ONE of the URIs):
```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/skilllink
# or (Atlas):
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/skilllink?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Start MongoDB:
- **Local**: ensure `mongod` is running (service/app).  
  Or run it manually in another terminal:
  ```bash
  mongod
  ```

Run the API:
```bash
npm run dev
# API available at: http://localhost:3000
```

Quick health check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# -> {"ok":true}
```

**(Optional) Seed sample data**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed
```

### 4) Frontend Setup
Open a **new terminal**:
```bash
cd frontend
```

Serve the static files (pick one):
```bash
# VS Code extension: Live Server (recommended)
#  - Right-click index.html -> "Open with Live Server"

# OR Python simple server:
python -m http.server 5500
# Visit: http://localhost:5500
```

Make sure the frontend points to your API in `frontend/script.js`:
```js
const API_BASE = "http://localhost:3000/api";
```
